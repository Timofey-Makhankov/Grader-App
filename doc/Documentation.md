# The Vision for Grader Application Software

## Summary of This Document

This Document is for documenting my Journy on creating a Project. This Project is going to be an Android Application through Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

## Problem Statement & the scope

The Problem Statemnet is, creating an Application to store Grades to specific Semesters and Schools and be able to easily Calculate Grades that are needed to pass Exams or Semesters. One of the Motivation for it is that I had some teachers not tech literate and were unable to write a single two digit Number online. The Other reason is, that many Schools use diffrent Systems to put Grades Online. This makes it harder to have an Overall Idea of how your Grades are all together.

The Scope of the Project is to create a Free Open Sourse Project with the GNU GPL3 Licence. The Reason is, if a given task is able to be performed by only a pen and paper, the Applcation shouldn't be payed. That's the mentality I go by. The Application should also be independant from other Applications and be available offline.

## The Goal of the Document

The Goal of the Document should be: That the Reader be able to learn the concepts of building of similar Project by reading the Documentation. To be able to show my Reasearch and the learning Process of this project. Finally, showing the Problems that I encountered and show Solutions I found

## Requirements of the Application

The Main Requirements are:

- To be able to save Grades on the Application

- To be able to Calculate the Average Grades, given Settings

- Export the Data as JSON and CSV

There are Secondary Requirements after the Main:

- Be in Multiple Languages (EN, DE, RU)

- The ability to change the Theme

- Grading Colors, if enabled

- Password Security

There a also nice to have Features:

- PDF Export

- Wish-Note Calculator

- Standalone grade Calculator
